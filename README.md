### ***Description***
The pokemon review appallows users to view different pokemon games. Users can interact with it by clicking on any game, when clicked the app takes you that games review page. In this page the game selected wil render its image and details, users can also add a review, update a review and even delete a review. The app has two more components where the user can add a game and view the different pokemon regions.
### ***Technologies Used***
* CSS Grid
* Event listeners
    * Load event
    * Click event
* React
### ***Getting Started***
##### We first set up the server for pokemon games and reviews. Games and models will be two different models. This will allow use to use api calls using axios from the back end. In the front end we want to start by making routes so that the user has functionality. In the home page we want to render the games by using axios. After we set up reviews in another component and make it display when the user clicks on the game. Here we add functionality to have full CRUD for our review model.
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of the development progress and can be viewed [here.](https://trello.com/b/k5wOt0qR/pokedex)

### ***Future Updates***
- [ ] Make it so that each game has its own review
- [ ] For regions component, have it so that when users click on region map, it displays region details.
